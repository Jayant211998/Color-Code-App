This is a simple React based application in which you just need to set the color code in the fields according to its hex value and you can see the color in the background.
Also it is taking data from a csv file which is a kind of dictonary for color name and color code. So You can search for a basic color name and then change the hex codes accordingly to get your desired color.
Also you can click on "Get Color" button to get the name of color you choose. If it is in csv file it will show the color name otherwise it will give no color name.
